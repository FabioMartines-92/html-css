<h1>       THE HISTORY OF THE ANDROID MASCOT     </h1>
        <p>
        You probably know that the <strong>Android</strong> operating system, maintained by <strong>Google</strong>, is one of the most widely used systems for mobile devices around the world.
        But maybe you don’t know that its friendly mascot has a name and a very curious story. Follow along with this article to learn more about this little robot.
           </p>
         <h2>THE FIRST VERSION </h2>
            <p>
                The first attempt to create a mascot appeared in 2007 and came from a developer named <a href="https://www.thedrum.com/news/2013/01/06/googles-dan-morrill-reveals-rejected-android-mascot-designs" target="_blank" class="externo">Dan Morrill</a>.
                He says that he opened <a href="https://inkscape.org/" target="_blank"class="externo">Inkscape</a> (a free software for vector graphics) and created his own version of a robot. The goal was just to personify the system for his team, there was no request from the company to create a mascot.
            </p>

            <p>
                This first bizarre version was even named after it's creator:
                they were called the <strong>Dandroids</strong>
            </p>
            <h2>A NEW MASCOT APPEARS</h2>
            <p>
                The idea of havind a mascot started to evolve and the mission was given to a professional in the field. A Russian illustrator <a href="https://www.irinablok.com/android" target="_blank" class="externo">Irina Blok</a>, also a Google employee, was tasked with representing the little robot in more pleasant way.
            </p>

                <img src="imagens/irina-blok.jpg" alt="female Russian illustrator">
            </picture>
            <p>
              Irina's main idea was to design everything with simple lines and a flat style. The drawing also had to generate quick recognition from anyone who looked at it.
              Anso so. <strong>Bugdroid</strong> the new Android mascot was born.
            </p>
            <img src="imagens/bugdroid.png" alt="Bugdroid" id="bugdroid" class="pequena">
            <p>
                The main inspiration for the Bugdroid's design came from those little icons used on bathroom doors to indicate gender.
                Legend has it that Irina was sketching at her desk in Googles's office, looked over at the restrooms, and the inspiration was immediate: simple, clean, and straightfoward.

                        Another fun fact about Android is thay each version was named after a dessert, in alphabetical order, from version 1.5 up to 9.0:
                    </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>1.5 - Cupcake</li>
                            <li>1.6 - Donut</li>
                            <li>2.0/2.1 - Eclair</li>
                            <li>2.2 - Froyo</li>
                            <li>2.3 - Gingerbread</li>
                            <li>3.0 - Honeycomb</li>
                            <li>4.0 - Ice Cream Sandwich</li>
                            <li>4.1 - Jelly Bean</li>
                            <li>4.4 - KitKat</li>
                            <li>5.0 - Lollipop</li>
                            <li>6.0 - Marshmallow</li>
                            <li>7.0 - Nougat</li>
                            <li>8.0 - Oreo</li>
                            <li>9.0 - Pie</li>
                        </ul>
                    <p>
                        Unfortunately, <strong>Android 'Q'</strong> never existed, because Google decided to put an end to this playful tradition and started using simples numbers instead, beginning with <strong>Android 10</strong>.
